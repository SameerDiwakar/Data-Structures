# Data Structures and Algorithms in C and C++

Organized implementations of data structures and algorithms in **C** and **C++**, structured for clarity and ease of navigation. Each topic includes example implementations, concepts, and practice problems to help master DSA fundamentals and prepare for technical interviews.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

The repository is divided into the following topics, each containing relevant C/C++ files:

1. **Recursion**  
   Basics of recursion, advanced examples, and practice problems.

2. **Arrays Representation**  
   Memory representation of arrays and operations like traversal, insertion, and deletion.

3. **Array ADT (Abstract Data Type)**  
   Implementation of array as an ADT with essential operations.

4. **Linked List**  
   Singly linked list, doubly linked list, and circular linked list implementations.

5. **Stack**  
   Array-based and linked list-based stack implementations, including common operations.

6. **Queues**  
   Implementation of simple queues, circular queues, and priority queues.

7. **Trees**  
   Binary tree implementation and traversal techniques (inorder, preorder, postorder).

8. **Binary Search Tree**  
   Implementation of BST with operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.

9. **AVL Trees**  
   Self-balancing binary search tree with rotations for balancing.

10. **Graphs**  
   Representation of graphs using adjacency matrix and list, graph traversal (BFS, DFS), and shortest path algorithms.

11. **Hashing Technique**  
   Implementation of hashing with collision resolution techniques (chaining, open addressing).
